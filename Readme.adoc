= The Speckled Egg

This is a children's story I'm tightening up. I am open and thankful for any feedback, critique or editing I can find.

This story among several more will be published into Gemini (protocol) Space. There needs to be new content, as it is pretty bare but nevertheless an exhuberent community. 

A decidedly non-commercial network protocol. I like it. And I really could use some help winnowing out the crap in my writing before publishing it via Gemini.

Cheers.
