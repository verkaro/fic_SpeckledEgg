= The Speckled Egg

This is a whimsical story, adapted from the Brothers G.

I am working on a collection to be released into Gemini Space (aka that protocol somewhere between Gopher and the WWW).

If anyone feels like adding their eyes to this work I would appreciate it. I consider self published prose without feedback from readers and editors to be generally weak. Sure I can publish as-is but it could be so much better. Takers?

Thank you
Warren R.Smith
